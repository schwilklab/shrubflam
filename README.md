# Shrub Flammability Project 

## Overview


## Measurements:

 - Leaf Area measured in cm^2.
 - Fresh mass and dry mass for LMA and moisture content measured in gram.
 - Width of canopy density measured in Inches.
 - Disc temperature measured in degrees C. Note that IR temperature gun ( Fluke 572-2 IR Thermometer) is set to assume emissivity of the disk is 0.95.
 - Air temperature measured in Farenheit.Will convert into celsius at the end!!
 - burn trial climate data taken with Nielsen Kellerman,Kestrel-3000 weather meter. Wind speed in miles per hour, Temperature in Farenheit, Relative Humidity in Percentage.
 - ONSET HOBO MX2301A is used for measuring weather data of drying period.
 - HOBO U12 J, K, S, T Thermocouple Data Logger (U12-014) is used to get the thermocouples data from the barbecue aparatus.

 
  

## Burning trials notes

# Thermocouples and Disks distnce from the scale ( By which measuring the flame height)
# Distances 
 - From scale to first thermocouple 19.05 cm
 - From scale to disk one 31.75 cm
 - From scale to second thermometer 40.64 cm
 - From scale to disk two 57.15 cm
 - From scale to third thermocouple 69.85 cm

# Height:

From bed (where we put the sample for pre-heation) to first thermocouple 17.78 cm
From bed (where we put the sample for pre-heation) to disc one 16.51 cm
From bed (where we put the sample for pre-heation) to second thermocouple 18.415 cm
From bed (where we put the sample for pre-heation) to disc two 17.145
From bed (where we put the sample for pre-heation) to third thermocouple 20.32 cm
## Other notes


 - Haven't measured the maximum temperature for first nine sample plus ED35.
 - Maximum temperature measured by pointing the infrared thermometer at the burning site after ten seconds ignition.
 - Two infrred thermometer showed two different temperature.I used the new, yellow one ( Fluke 572-2 IR Thermometer).
 - Drying period was 24 hours for first burn for first nine samples.
 - Few samples were less than 70 cm from the first trip.
 - Got the hobo data (temperature and humidity of the drying period) only from the last second burn of second trip.
 - Got 24 hours of hobo data of the second burn of second trip samples.
 - The leaf sample for ED11 is missing and I didn't measure it's LMA.
 - I have confusion with some species in terms of identification.
 - Species like juniper, mimosa, pinus I did measured only the projection not the morphological leaf area.
 - *Senegalia wrightii* and *Senegalia romeriana* are morphologically similar and treated as a single species.
 - Looks like *Quercus buckleyi* and *Q. shummardii* are similar in terms of morphology.
 - Want to add Juniperus pinchottii,Forestiera reticulata, Rhus trilobata, Garrya elliptica.
 - Haven't found the Garrya elliptica in Dickens Park.
 - Flame duration of RE03 is 5:18 or 318 seconds.
