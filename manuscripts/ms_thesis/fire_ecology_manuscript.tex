\parttitle{Background} %if any
Flammability is a trait of land plants, and an understanding of this trait is important for understanding the ecological and evolutionary consequences of fire on plant species in fire-prone ecosystems. Although many studies have examined the flammability of individual leaves, fewer have examined how entire canopies behave as fuel. In this study, we used a plant flammability device that allows standardized measurements of canopy flammability of portions up to 70\,cm long. We burned branches of 16 native shrubs of Texas and measured four canopy traits: total dry mass per 70\,cm branch, canopy density per 70\,cm branch, leaf: stem per 70\,cm branch (in dry mass basis) and canopy moisture content and four common leaf traits: leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf area per leaf, leaf length per leaf and leaf moisture content. We used these data to answer two questions: 1) Canopy or leaf traits are better at predicting shoot flammability? 2) Are heat release and flame spread rate independent axes of flammability in shrub fuels? 

\parttitle{Results} 
We found that canopy traits are more important in determining flammability than leaf traits; total dry mass per 70\,cm branch and canopy density together were the best predictors of temperature integration. Furthermore, we found that shoot flammability in shrub fuel is mostly described by a single axis, represented by flammability metrics related to flame duration.

\parttitle{Conclusions}
To our knowledge, this study is the first to have compared the relative weights of canopy and leaf traits in determining shoot flammability. This finding illustrates the potential for incorporating canopy traits in fire behavior models, and might help forest and fire managers in making well--informed decisions about fuel management. This study represents a significant step towards enhancing our understanding of the fire-fuel feedback in crown fire ecosystems.

\section*{Background}
Fire is a dominant driver of change in many terrestrial ecosystems and flammability is a biological trait \citep{pausasandmoi2012flammability}. Vegetation fuels fire, which in turn affects vegetation %\citep{bova2005linking, jones2006prediction, kavanagh2010way,o2010acute, michaletz2012moving, west2016experimental, lodge2018xylem, bar2019fire}
and understanding plant flammability is essential for understanding the vegetation--fire feedbacks in fire--prone ecosystems \citep{ keeley2011fire, pausas2012fire}. Fuels, fires, and fire effects are heterogeneous over space \citep{gagnon2010does, o2018advances}, yet many studies investigating the effect of fire on vegetation take place after fires, with little information on fire behavior \citep{o2018advances}. Different plant species and communities burn differently, and a previous study suggested that vegetation--fire feedback in crown fire ecosystems is ecosystem specific \citep{pausas2004plant}. 
Fuel varies structurally and many plant traits can influence flammability. %Therefore, accurate knowledge of plant traits--flammability relationship is important for understanding the fire-vegetation feedback on a larger scale \citep{pausasandmoi2012flammability}.
However, although we have been witnessing an increasing trend of high--severity wildfires in many parts of the world \citep{miller2012trends, dennison2014large, weber2020spatiotemporal, salguero2020wildfire}, the mechanistic understanding of the canopy traits--flammability relationship is not well documented.

Plant flammability is the general capacity of vegetation to burn. Different physical and chemical characteristics of plants affect how susceptible they are to burning \citep{bond1996fire}. It is well recognized that flammability differs between and within species \citep{jaureguiberry2011device, pausas2012fire, calitz2015investigating, wyse2016quantitative, battersby2017exploring, cui2020shoot, zanzarini2022flammability, potts2022growth, cui2022intraspecific}. However, measuring the flammability of plants on an individual scale and predicting fire behavior at larger scales is challenging. One complication is that the concept of flammability differ among authors and discipline \citep{gill2005flammability} and methodological differences across studies make comparisons difficult. Historically, flammability was considered as consisting of four different components: ignitibility (the ability to start fire), combustibility (the mass loss rate of fuel per unit of time), consumability (the amount of fuel consumed or burned), and sustainability (the amount of time flame or combustion lasted) \citep{anderson1970forest, martin1993assessing}. However, empirical evidence suggests that these metrics are inter--correlated and most work indicates that flammability has three major dimensions: ignitability, total heat release, and fire spread rate \citep{pausas2017flammability}. These dimensions may be independent of one another for a particular scale but might be correlated at other scales. For example, past work in surface fire systems suggested that the flammability of leaf litter varies along two largely orthogonal dimensions, total heat release and flame spread rate \citep{scarff2006leaf, de2012leaf, cornwell2015flammability}. More recently, \citet{prior2018conceptualizing} suggested that these two main axes can be used to describe flammability at the community scale and successfully predict fire severity for a wide range of frequently measured flammability metrics.

%The overall tendency of vegetation to ignite and spread fire is strongly influenced by the flammability of dominant plant species \citep{bond1995kill}. 
A previous study demonstrated that plant traits known to influence flammability in laboratory settings can be linked to field-scale fire behavior metrics \citep{tumino2019plant}. However, studies of the traits that determine a plant's flammability, particularly at an individual scale, are rare. Part of the reason is the lack of comparable, cost--effective protocols to measure the flammability of whole plants over large numbers of species \citep{jaureguiberry2011device}. Although burning the whole plant would provide more detailed information about its flammability, doing so is expensive and logistically challenging \citep{jaureguiberry2011device, pausasandmoi2012flammability}. Therefore, many flammability studies included burning individual leaves to predict canopy flammability, but fewer considered the geometry of plant parts which has a great influence on fire behavior \citep{madrigal2012evaluation, pausas2012firesulex, calitz2015investigating, gao2018grass}. However, recent studies suggest that measuring flammability by burning entire shoots is better at predicting plant flammability than burning leaves \citep{alam2020shoot} and individual leaf flammability is a poor predictor of crown fire behavior \citep{fernandes2012plant}. As a consequence, it is recommended to use methods that measure the flammability of partial plant canopies which retains the special arrangement of plant parts \citep{schwilk2015dimensions, perez2016corrigendum}.



The plant traits that influence plant flammability are different on different scales \citep{pausas2017flammability}. For example, at the leaf scale, leaf morphology and chemistry determines the way leaf burns \citep{anderson1970forest, owens1998seasonal, schwilk2011scaling, pausas2016secondary, guerrero2021leaf, ganteaume2021volatile,alam2020shoot}. At larger scale, fuel compactness, canopy's leaf cover, fuel bulk density are attributes that influence fire behaviour \citep{ ray2005micrometeorological, tachajapong2008investigation, madrigal2012evaluation}. For example, \citet{wagner1977conditions} classified crown fire based on the spatial arrangement of fuel structure such as the crown--layer fuel bulk density. However, whether the canopy traits outweigh the leaf traits in shoot--level flammability or not  has yet to be tested \citep{alam2020shoot}.




Our goal was to investigate the importance of traits in controlling the shoot flammability of native shrubs of Texas. 
We burned a total of 116 samples, 3-12 individuals per species across 16 common shrub species of Texas to measure flammability. We measured four common canopy traits: total dry mass per 70 \,cm branch, canopy density per 70\,cm branch,  leaf: stem (in dry mass basis, per 70\,cm branch) and canopy moisture content, as well as four common leaf traits: LMA, leaf area per leaf, leaf length per leaf and leaf moisture content. We used these data to answer two questions: 1). Canopy or leaf traits are better at predicting shoot flammability? 2). Are heat release and flame spread independent axes of flammability in shrub fuels? Our research, investigating the importance of structural traits of native shrubs on shoot--level flammability might help to improve the understanding of the fire--fuel feedback in crown fire ecosystems.

\section*{Methods}
\subsection*{Site selection}
The species were selected from the shrub species found on the properties we had access to collect samples during our preliminary visits to those properties.  To collect samples, we traveled to fourteen different properties in eleven counties in Texas (Bandera, Edwards, Menard, Duval, Uvalde, Kendall, Bastrop, Dickens, Van Zandt, Real, Bell).   
Plant samples were collected during summer (late May -- early August) 2022 from 16 native shrub species. The number of studied species from each property was maximized in light of the potential variance in flammability within species. 
\begin{table}
    \centering
    \caption{List of studied species and the number of properties where each species was found.}
    \label{tab:species_table}
    \begin{tabular}{lrr}
    \hline
    \textbf{Species} & \textbf{Number of Properties}\\
    \hline
    \emph{Diospyros texana} & 8 \\
    \emph{Juniperus ashei}    & 5\\
    \emph{Mahonia trifoliolata} & 5\\
    \emph{Sophora secundiflora} & 5\\
    \emph{Rhus virens} & 5 \\
    \emph{Senegalia wrightii} & 4\\
    \emph{Prosopis glandulosa} & 4\\
    \emph{Ilex vomitoria } & 4 \\
    \emph{Sarcomphalus obtusifolia} & 3\\
    \emph{Juniperus virginiana} & 2\\
    \emph{Forestiera pubescens} & 2\\
    \emph{Rhus trilobata} & 1\\
    \emph{Juniperus pinchotii} & 1\\
    \emph{Senegalia berlandieri} & 1\\
    \emph{Zanthoxylum fagara} & 1\\
    \emph{Coleogyne ramosissima} & 1\\
    \end{tabular}
    
\end{table}
However, not all the species were found in every property (Table \ref{tab:species_table}). Due to the challenge of differentiating \emph{Senegalia wrightii} from \emph{Senegalia greggii} without flowers during sampling, we treated them as a single taxon. We recorded the coordinates of the collection site by GPS, took pictures of each sample  and collected specimens of unidentified shrubs.
The sampled individuals were chosen from those who were in good health and did not appear to be under water stress. We collected three samples from each mature, healthy individual. Two of them comprised a pair of 70\,cm long shoot samples. These were chosen to be visually similar, healthy-looking terminal branches. We chose paired samples to allow one to be used later in flammability trials and the other to be used for destructive leaf and stem measurements. The third sample provided leaves for leaf trait measurements. The destructive measurements shoot sample was cut into sections, sealed inside a plastic food storage bag, and placed on ice in a cooler for later measurements. The shoot sample destined for burning trials was kept intact and placed inside a large sealable plastic bag (Ziploc BIG BAGS, SC Johnson, 60 \,cm × 82 \,cm × 18 \,cm). The leaves sample was placed in a small sealable plastic bag.

A paper towel, saturated with water was placed inside the plastic bags to maintain 100 \% relative humidity inside the bag and eliminate further drying after cutting. To avoid puncturing the plastic bag, we used a large cotton towel to wrap samples from species with spines or thorns. All the samples were placed inside an insulated cooler on ice and transported to Texas Tech University within five days of collection.  
At the lab, the intact shoot samples were left to bench dry for 36 hours in the lab before burning trials  as per established methods \citep{wyse2016quantitative}. A data logger (HOBO MX2300 temp/RH, Onset, Bourne, MA) recorded the temperature and humidity in the lab during the drying period at one minute intervals.

\subsection*{Trait measurements}
The sampled branch assigned to destructive harvests was used for measuring the leaf and stem biomass. This branch was separated into leaves and stems for separate drying and weighing. The leaves, including petiole and rachis, were separated from the stem and their fresh mass was measured before placing them in a paper bag for drying. Following the measurement of the fresh mass, the leaves and stems were each dried at $65^{\circ}$C for at least 48 hours before weighing. Canopy density was measured during the drying period of the burned sample. We visually assigned each branch as approximating one of three possible geometric shapes: cylinder, truncated cone, or the combination of two truncated cones connected at their wide end. For those samples assigned the cylinder shape, we measured the diameter of the branch at three different positions, averaged those measurements, and calculated the volume according to the formula of the volume of a cylinder. For those samples assigned the truncated cone shape, we measured the diameter at both ends and calculated it according to the appropriate equations. For those samples assigned the double truncated cone shape, we measured the maximum diameter, the distance of the maximum diameter from the distal and proximal ends of the branch, and the diameters at the distal and proximal ends. We then calculated the combined volume of the truncated cones. Canopy density was calculated by dividing the total dry mass of the sample by the canopy volume.




The leaflet of compound leaves is functionally similar to a simple leaf
\citep{perez2016corrigendum}. Therefore, we used the leaflet for compound leaves to measure the leaf traits. Leaf area per leaf, leaf length per leaf, and LMA were measured on the leaf samples. We used five leaves for the majority of the species. For species with small leaf the number of leaf was not fixed. We used a ruler scale to measure each leaf's length, including the petiole, and then we weighed the leaves both when they were fresh and then after 48 hours of 65 $^{\circ}$C oven drying. A Licor 3100 leaf area meter, which can measure the surface area of leaves, was used to measure the total fresh leaf area. Each time before measurements, the leaf area meter was calibrated. The leaves were positioned so that they laid flat on the bed and did not overlap with one another.   
LMA was then calculated on  dry mass basis. The projected and total leaf area is different for non-flat leaves \citep{perez2016corrigendum, cornelissen2003handbook}. Therefore, we measured the leaf area of the three species from \emph{Juniperus} taxon manually. For those three Cupressaceae species, we used branchlet rather than leaf, similar to \citet{schwilk2011scaling}. We assumed that the branchlets are cylindrical in shape. The length and width of the branchlets were treated as the height and diameter of a cylinder respectively. We used ten branchlets for each sample and measured the diameter and length of each branchlets with slide calipers and a meter scale respectively. Based on the formula for calculating a cylinder's surface area, the area of the branchlets was calculated. The 10 branchlets were weighed fresh and then dried in an oven for 48 hours at 65 $^{\circ}$C to obtain the dry weight.


\section*{Flammability trials}

We conducted flammability trials using a specially-built device that allows standardized measurements of the canopy flammability of branch portions up to 70\,cm long \citep{jaureguiberry2011device}. The procedure calls for preheating the 70\,cm branch on the grill (84 x 55 \,cm) for two minutes before lighting the sample with a blowtorch. The grill was heated by a flame created by propane gas. Preheating is crucial for simulating wildfires in nature, because live fuel first acts as a heat sink after being exposed to tremendous heat before drying out and eventually reaching a flash point when they begin to burn. In contrast to past studies conducted with similar apparatus, the others used thermometer attached along the grill to monitor the grill temperature \citep{jaureguiberry2011device}, we used two black aluminum discs  suspended from the wind protection shield and spaced approximately 19 \,cm (the center of the discs) apart from the grill's surface. This method is similar to that employed by \citet{gao2022burn} to measure heat transfer, an important fire behavior metric. Before placing the samples on the grill, the temperature of the discs was measured and the heat output of the propane burner was adjusted to keep these disks within a ranged from 130.25 to 163.30 $^{\circ}$C, with a mean of 148.79 $^{\circ}$C temperature  during the experiment. The two minute preheating period before ignition is intended to equalize air temperature during the burn trial, however wind speed could influence burning and we used
a Kestrel 3000 pocket weather meter (Nielsen–Kellerman, Co.,Chester, PA, USA) to
measure the maximum wind speed before each trial. There are three missing values for wind speed for three samples, and we averaged the values based on trials for those samples. 
The pre and post--burning temperatures of each trial were also recorded to quantify the heat release (J). We also measured the flame height using a meter scale that was mounted to the flammability apparatus.


A few leaves (range: 0.044 -- 2.380 g, mean: 0.408 g) and a twig with leaves (range: 0.0796 -- 8.177 g, mean: 1.11 g) were detached from the sample to be burned right before burning in order to calculate the leaf moisture content and canopy moisture content respectively. The leaves and twig with leaves were weighed fresh and then dried in an oven for 48 hours at 65 $^{\circ}$C to obtain the dry weight and calculated the leaf moisture content and canopy moisture content on a dry mass basis. We measured the fresh weight of each sample using a portable balance (0.1 g readability) immediately before burning. We then laid the sample horizontally on the grill for two minutes for preheating. A Fluke 572-2 IR remote infrared thermometer, which can measure temperatures up to 900 $^{\circ}$C, was used to measure the aluminum discs' precombustion temperatures during the pre-heating phase. Some preliminary flammability trials showed that some samples from the most flammable species didn't ignite within the allotted 10 second ignition period, therefore, we kept the blow torch on until a sample caught fire and treated the ignitibility as ignition delay \citep{anderson1970forest}.  
 

We used a thermocouple recording system to keep track of the flame temperatures during the burning trials. The flame temperatures were continually collected at three sites at intervals of one second using the most widely used, K-type thermocouple sensors \citep{mcgranahan2020inconvenient} attached to data loggers. An assistant continuously monitored the maximum flame height for each trial and measured it using the meter scale. When the flame was extinguished, we recorded the post-burn temperature of the discs, the time it took to ignite, and the overall burning time in seconds with a stopwatch. After the burn, we calculated the percentage consumed and weighed the leftover biomass. To reduce observer error, the proportion of the volume burned was visually estimated and agreed upon by at least two people. Those samples that caught fire during preheating were counted as zero seconds as ignition delay. Each trial's average gas flow from the propane gas cylinder was 20.35\,$g min^{-1}$. Three flammability metrics: temperature integration over 100$^{\circ}$C ($^{\circ}$C.s), duration over 100$^{\circ}$C, and peak temperature were measured using thermocouples data.

\section*{Data analysis}

All data analysis was conducted in R, version 4.2.2 \citep{R}. 
Flammability includes separate measurements that do not necessarily correlate with one another, therefore the first step before further analysis was to use principle components analyses (PCA) to transform the measured variables into orthogonal axes of variation. The measured variables were in different units. Therefore, the correlation matrix in the \pkg{prcomp} function was specified. %In terms of fire ecology, it is not just the amount of heat generated during a fire that is important, but also the duration \citep{mcgranahan2020inconvenient}, because the thresholds for temperature and time-related mortality driven by fire vary for different organisms \citep{nelson1952observations,vines1968heat, bond1983dead, hengst1994bark,pinard1997fire,lawes2011bark, pingree2019myth} due to the avoidance–attraction traits for fire \citep{schwilk2001flammability, archibald2019unified}. Moreover, seasonal variations also affect how long a plant must be exposed to a certain temperature before it is killed by fire \citep{wright1970method}. As a result, the response variable temperature integration over 100 ($^{\circ}$C.s),
The temperature integration over 100 ($^{\circ}$C.s) which represented the sum of the average temperatures over each second during the same period, often used as a proxy measurement of heat release, was chosen as the response variable \citep{gao2018grass, mcgranahan2020inconvenient}. Moreover, the effect of canopy traits on ignitibility has not been well documented for shoot--level flammability. Therefore, the ignition delay was also selected as a response variable. Due to the hierarchical structure of the data, to determine the importance of traits on flammability, we built linear mixed effects models with genus as a random variable since flammability is phylogenetically conserved \citep{cui2020shoot} and we assumed that morphologically similar species would behave similarly in a wildfire. However, all the species in this study except the three species of \emph{Juniperus} taxon,
are morphologically distinct, and they were treated as individual taxon. To avoid the  Type I error and an overestimation of the amount of variance explained that could arise from forward selection method \citep{blanchet2008forward}, initially, two separate global linear mixed effects models were built, where each type of trait with two-way interaction were the fixed effects and the temperature integration was the response variable. The \pkg{lmer} function from the \pkg{afex} package \citep{singmann2015packageafex,afexluke2017evaluating} was used to perform the mixed effects model. 
To check the collinearity among predictor variables and make the fixed effects comparable, we created the correlation matrix and standardized the independent variables as z-score. However, the log transformation of the response variable to satisfy the normal error assumption can result in different coefficient estimations, frequently unrelated to the original data, can alter the relationship between the original variables, and biased error variance estimations of the coefficient particularly for response variable having zero \citep{mccuen1990problems,packard2008model,o2010not, changyong2014log, st2018count}. Moreover, this dataset is small and unbalanced, therefore, there was no transformation applied to the response variable. The Kendall rank correlation coefficient between leaf area per leaf and leaf length per leaf is 0.65 (see \textbf{supplementary information}), and we decided to use only the leaf length per leaf in the model because previous flammability studies used leaf length to predict flammability \citep{alam2020shoot}. 
The best model from all the subsets of the global model for each type of trait was selected by the Akaike information criterion ($AIC_{c}$). The automated model selection was performed by the \pkg{MuMin} package \citep{barton2015packagemumin}. We compared the best leaf traits model against the best canopy traits model according to log-likelihoods. After selecting the best predictors for each type of trait, the mixed effects models with best leaf and canopy traits were built with the \pkg{lme4} package in R \citep{bates2009package} using maximum likelihood estimation in order to evaluate the significance of fixed effects. We used the Anova() function from the \pkg{car} package \citep{fox2013hypothesis} to test the significance of predictors. Type  2  sums  of  squares  were  calculated  for testing the hypothesis \citep{langsrud2003anova}. To avoid unacceptable type 1 error, estimated degrees of freedom of residuals and p-values were calculated using the Kenward--Roger approximation \citep{kenward1997small}. All the plots were generated by \pkg{ggplot2} and \pkg{factoextra} package \citep{wickham2016packageggplot2, kassambara2017packagefactoextra}.



\section*{Results}

\subsection*{Flammability axes}

According to the principle component analysis, the first two principal components accounted for 78.6\% of the variation of all the measured flammability metrics. The first axis captured 69.1\% of the total variation (Figure \ref{fig:pca-plot}). The temperature integration in the first axis received the most contributions and six flammability traits had a strong positive correlation with one another (loadings: temperature integration over 100 $^{\circ}$C = 0.38, flame duration = 0.37, duration over 100C $^{\circ}$C = 0.37, mass-consumed = 0.37, peak temperature  = 0.36, percentage of volume burned = 0.35). The second axis of PCA explained 9.5\% of the total variation and the ignition delay and heat release (j) both contributed the most in the second principle component and were negatively correlated with each other (loading: ignition delay = -0.71, heat release (j) = 0.59).

\subsection*{Effect of canopy traits and leaf traits on temperature integration}
The automated model selection result showed that, for canopy traits, the model with total dry mass and canopy density without interaction (Table \ref{tab:canopy_models}) was the best fit to predict temperature integration and \MakeUppercase{lma} alone was the best fit as predictor among all the leaf traits (Table \ref{tab:leaf_models}). The model with canopy traits was better at fitting the data set compared to leaf traits ($AIC_{c}$ value: best canopy traits model = 2491.8, best leaf traits model = 2585.0). We built another linear mixed effect model using the best canopy traits, mean pre--burning disc temperature and wind speed as  covariate to see whether adding pre--burning temperature and wind speed during trials improved the model or not. We found that, adding pre--burning temperature and wind speed didn't improve the model ($AIC_{c}$ value: best canopy traits model = 2491.8, pre--burning temperature and wind speed model = 2494.7).

After getting the best predictors for temperature integration for each type of traits from the initial model selection, we tested the significance of the relationship  between predictors and the response variable. Both the total dry mass and canopy density had a significant positive linear effect  
on temperature integration above 100 $^{\circ}$C. Marginal and conditional $R^2$ for the model with total dry mass and canopy density without interaction was  0.63 and 0.75 respectively (total dry mass : p $<$ 0.001, canopy density: $p = 0.011$), see \textbf{supplementary information} (Table \ref{tab:fandpstatfortemp}). LMA had also a significant positive effect on temperature integration above 100 $^{\circ}$C. Marginal  and conditional $R^2$ for the model with LMA was 0.05 and 0.50 respectively (LMA: $p = 0.020$), see \textbf{supplementary information}. The majority of the canopy traits among all the measured canopy traits had higher values for the species from the \emph{Juniperus} taxon. Specifically, \emph{Juniperus ashei} and \emph{Juniperus pinchotii} and the measurements of the leaf traits was also error prone due to having the non--flat leaves for those species. In order to understand how this taxon influenced the results, we removed the species from the \emph{Juniperus} taxon from the analysis and then examined the impact of those traits on the remaining species. After removing the \emph{Juniperus} species from the analysis, the total dry mass still had a strong positive effect ($p $<$ 0.001$)(Figure \ref{fig:dm-tempint}), but neither canopy density nor LMA have any significant effect on temperature integration for the remaining species (canopy density: $p = 0.367$, LMA: $p = 0.901$), see \textbf{supplimentary information}.

\subsection*{Effect of canopy and leaf traits on ignition delay}
For ignition delay, the global linear mixed effects model were built without any interaction term  to avoid over fitting problem since ignition source \citep{anderson1970forest, madrigal2012evaluation} and many unmeasured traits like volatile compounds can influence ignitibility. For canopy traits, the model with canopy density and canopy moisture content was the best fit to predict ignition delay (Table \ref{tab:canopy_models_ignition_delay}) and LMA and leaf moisture content was the best fit as predictor among all the leaf traits (Table \ref{tab:leaf_models_ignition_delay}). The model with canopy traits was better at fitting the data set compared to leaf traits ($AIC_{c}$ value: best canopy traits model = 579.7, best leaf traits model = 585.4). We built another linear mixed effects model using the best canopy traits,  mean pre--burning disc temperature and wind speed as  covariate to see whether adding pre--burning temperature and wind speed improved the model or not. We found that, adding pre--burning temperature and wind speed didn't improve the model ($AIC_{c}$ value: best canopy traits model = 579.7, pre--burning temperature wind speed model = 582.2).

After removing \emph{Juniperus} from the analysis, none of the traits from the best models had significant effect on ignition delay other than leaf moisture content (canopy density: $p = 0.423$ , LMA: $p = 0.330$, leaf moisture content: $p = 0.048$), see \textbf{supplementary information}. Leaves are one of the first plant parts to catch fire. Therefore, since leaf moisture content and canopy moisture content are highly correlated (the kendall rank correlation coefficient is .64, see \textbf{supplementary information}), to minimize the number of models, the canopy moisture content was removed from the model that was used to test the effect of those traits on ignition delay after removing the three species from the \emph{Juniperus} taxon.

\section*{Discussion}
We found that canopy traits are more important than leaf traits in shoot flammability in shrub fuels. Specifically, species with higher amounts of fuel per 70\,cm branch and higher canopy density per 70\,cm branch burned for longer period of time and consumed more biomass. These observations are consistent with the importance of the spatial arrangement of plant parts such as the bulk density \citep{pausas2012firesulex} and higher proportion of tree shoots \citep{potts2022growth} in laboratory--scale flammability experiments. These observations are also consistent with the importance of fuel structure such as bulk density in fire behavior at field scale \citep{tumino2019plant}. At larger scale, for example, tree crown's density is an important determinant of wildfire in coniferous forests \citep{bond1996fire}. \citet{stephens2022mass} also demonstrated that the live tree density can predict the fire severity in the Southern Sierra Nevada. Therefore, incorporating fuel structure along with species specific flammability in fire behavior model might improve our understanding of the vegetation--fire feedback in crown fire ecosystems. 

Architectural branching designs vary among plants \citep{halle2012tropical} and plant architecture can be shaped by different selective pressures \citep{danell1994browseeffects, schwilk2003flammability} and interacts with other morphological and life history traits \citep{ackerly1998leaf, schwilk2001flammability, archibald2003growing}. A recent study suggests that considering the dissimilarities in branching patterns can improve plant scaling models \citep{bentley2013empirical}. Specifically, plant shoots as phytomers are influenced by the interaction between genotype and environmental pressure \citep{mcsteen2005shoot, wang2008molecular}. Therefore, it is reasonable to treat a terminal branch from a given plant sample as a canopy trait rather than the 
representative of the total fuel load of that plant.

Leaf mass per area (LMA), one of the most important traits for describing leaf economics \citep{wright2004worldwide} appeared to be the most important determinant of temperature integration among all the measured leaf traits in this study. LMA is related to leaf thickness \citep{niinemets1999research}, and species with high LMA generally have more dense leaf tissue \citep{poorter2009causes}. Like leaf dry matter content (LDMC) in shoot flammability \citep{alam2020shoot, potts2022growth}, this observation was also likely due to the denser leaf tissue, which allows for longer burning. However, an additional step in the model selection results showed that adding the LMA to the best canopy traits model didn't improve the best canopy traits model, see \textbf{supplementary information}. Moreover, this relationship is not significance after removing the most flammable taxon from the analysis which further confirms that the temperature integration was mostly driven by canopy traits in this experiment.

We found that the two most important determinants of ignition delay for canopy traits were canopy density and canopy moisture content. The more compact the litter bed, the lesser the oxygen  \citep{scarff2006leaf, van2012species, engber2012patterns, de2012leaf, cornwell2015flammability}.  
Therefore, unlike litter flammability where the overall flammability is oxygen--limited \citep{schwilk2015dimensions}, in shoot--level flammability, to some extent, only the ignition of fuel might be oxygen limited. For the leaf traits, the thicker leaves took longer to ignite compared to the thinner leaves which is consistent with previous shoot flammability study \citep{alam2020shoot}.  However, \citet{montgomery1971effect} pointed out that "Low ignitibility does not necessarily mean low flammability".  For example, in shoot flammability, some species may take longer to ignite but might burn for longer period of time and produce more heat during burning. Moreover, \citet{anderson1970forest} and  \citet{madrigal2012evaluation} suggested that the ignition source can influence ignitibility. Therefore, for cases like this, for a constant heat for the source of ignition, particularly if the heat source produces less heat than the activation energy of the exothermic reaction, quantifying the ignitibility as ignition delay as suggested by \citep{anderson1970forest} might be an appropriate way to capture this phenomenon in shoot--level flammability experiment.

Aside from moisture content, none of the traits from the best models significantly affected ignition delay after the most flammable taxon \emph{Juniperus} was excluded from the analysis. This finding implies that, ignition delay was mostly driven by moisture content in this experiment. Previous study suggested that the ignition delay in shrub fuel is less than 15 seconds when the live fuel moisture content is less than 100\% but some species from \emph{Juniperus} taxon may take longer to ignite which is consistent with this study \citep{pellizzaro2007seasonal}. The maximum canopy moisture content (moisture content of twig with leaves) of burning samples in this study was 81.21 \% in \emph{Rhus trilobata} but the maximum ignition delay was 18 seconds for species from \emph{Juniperus} taxon, see \textbf{supplementary information}.
Moreover, some species from this study are well known for the volatile components in their leaves and some of them  ignited during the pre--heating period. Therefore, sometimes, the ignitibility in shoot flammability might be difficult to measure without measuring leaf chemical composition. 

Canopy density influences airflow in the canopy \citep{cionco1978analysis} and might be less effective for a single shoot to understand the impact of the limitation of the airflow and how a large amount of biomass interact with air flow in fire spread rate. For example, \citet{madrigal2012evaluation} suggested that the sustainability was primarily associated with physical characteristics, such as the interaction of air flow with fuel compactness in individual scale. Similarly, \citet{tachajapong2008investigation} demonstrated that crown fuel bulk density influences the crown fire dynamics such as the negative impact of crown fuel bulk density on average hot gas velocity inside the crown matrix.
Therefore, future studies are required to investigate to what extent the geometry of a 70\,cm terminal branch of a plant can capture the structural variation in three-dimensional space in terms of fire behavior. Moreover, in some ecosystems where the forest floor is wet, the fire spread rate in the canopy is high-density limited  \citep{ray2005micrometeorological}. Therefore, although the leaf traits like leaf length per leaf are less important in shoot-level flammability, in some ecosystems they might be influential in crown fire since species with larger leaves might be more aerated in the canopy, which affects the rate at which fires spread by permitting the flow of the hot and dry air. 

Texas and fire have a long history together \citep{moir1982firehistory, stambaugh2011firehistory,stambaugh2014historicalfirehistory,smeins2005historyoffire1}, and there were fire adapted species in this study (e.g. \emph{Prosopis glandulosa}) \citep{wright1976effect}. 
Moreover, all of the most flammable shrubs in this experiment are cone and seed--bearing plants 
and study suggests that fire influences seed coat chemistry \citep{mcinnes2022doesseedcoatchemistry} and in general, most flammable plants are reseeders \citep{midgley2011pushingreseeders}. Therefore,  the observed strong positive effect of total dry mass  and canopy density on flammability might be selected to spread fire to the surrounding plants because if fires kill nearby, less flammable neighbors and also increases fecundity, flammability may improve inclusive fitness \citep{bond1995kill}. However, those structural traits might also have other competitive advantages such as light harvesting. Moreover, Texas has a long history with grazing as well and herbivores can also influence the architecture of plants \citep{danell1994browseeffects}. A previous study regarding \emph{Juniperus ashei}, one of the most flammable species in this study, suggested that the enhanced flammability might be the response to herbivores in these ecosystems \citep{owens1998seasonal}. Moreover, a recent study also showed that \emph{Juniperus ashei} has an allelopathic relationship with \emph{Bouteloua curtipendula}, a native grass in this ecosystem \citep{young2009assessmentallelopathy}. Therefore, future studies are required to investigate whether it is a single evolutionary force or a combination of different selective pressure that drove the enhanced flammability in these ecosystem.
