Shrub Flammability Project
######### Overview
#### *Measurements:*
- Leaf Area measured in cm^2.
- The leaf area measured in LI-COR 3100 leaf area meter.
- Before measuring the leaf area of samples from each trip, the leaf area meter was calibrated by a small envelop whose area is 68.31 centimeter square.
- The rachis, petiole, were included in the leaf area.
- Fresh mass and dry mass for LMA and moisture content measured in gram.
- Width of canopy density measured in Inches.
- Disk temperature measured in degrees C. Note that IR temperature gun ( Fluke 572-2 IR Thermometer) is set to assume emissivity of the disk is 0.95.
- Air temperature measured in Farenheit. Will convert into celsius at the end!!
- Burn trial climate data taken with Nielsen Kellerman,Kestrel-3000 weather meter. Wind speed in miles per hour, Temperature in Farenheit, Relative Humidity in Percentage.
- ONSET HOBO MX2301A is used for measuring weather data of drying period.
- HOBO U12 J, K, S, T Thermocouple Data Logger (U12-014) is used to get the thermocouples data from the barbecue aparatus.
- The hobo.mid.csv of 06/04/2021 is missing.
#### *Leaf area per leaflet*
- Initially, I didn’t count the number of leaflet during measuring the LMA. Later, the number of leaflet in each sample counted from the dry mass of LMA samples in February 2022. The number of leaflet is not fixed for each samples.
#### *Juniperus leaf*
- The LMA of Juniperus leaf was measured in the same leaf area meter. Then later the leaf area is multiplied by pi since we assumed the needles as a cylinder and it will be the projected area of one side of each Juniperus leaf.
- The leaf area per leaflet of each Juniperus leaf calculated manually. The dry leaf samples from the dry mass of LMA is used to measured them and it is measured in February 2022. The length of each needle is measured by a ruler scale and the width is measured by a slide calipers and assumed the needle is cylindrical shape and calculated the area accordingly.
#### *Other notes*
- Haven’t measured the maximum temperature for first nine sample plus ED35.
- Maximum temperature measured by pointing the infrared thermometer at the burning site after ten seconds ignition period.
- Two infrared thermometer showed two different temperature.I used the new, yellow one ( Fluke 572-2 IR Thermometer).
- Drying period was 24 hours for first burn for first nine samples.
- Few samples were less than 70 cm from the first trip.
- Got the hobo data (temperature and humidity of the drying period) only from the last second burn of second trip.
- Got 24 hours of hobo data of the second burn of second trip samples.
- The leaf sample for ED11 is missing and I didn’t measure it’s LMA.
- I have confusion with some species in terms of identification.
- Species like juniper, mimosa, pinus I did measured only the projection not the morphological leaf area.
- *Senegalia wrightii* and *Senegalia romeriana* are morphologically similar and treated as a single species.
- Looks like *Quercus buckleyi* and *Q. shummardii* are similar in terms of morphology.
- Want to add Juniperus pinchottii,Forestiera reticulata, Rhus trilobata, Garrya elliptica.
- Haven’t found the Garrya elliptica in Dickens Park.
- Flame duration of RE03 is 5:18 or 318 seconds.
#### *Burning trials notes*
#### *Thermocouples and Disks (the middle of the disk) distnce from the scale ( By which measuring the flame height)*
#### *Distances*
