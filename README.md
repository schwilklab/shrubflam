# Shrub Flammability Project 

## Overview

[TODO]

## Measurements:

 - Leaf Area measured in cm^2.
 - Fresh mass and dry mass for LMA and moisture content measured in gram.
 - Width of canopy density measured in Inches. [WHAT!!! Why inches?  I'd change this in the data and clean it up.]
 - Disc temperature measured in degrees C. Note that IR temperature gun is set to assume emissivity of the disk is 0.95.
 - Air temperature measured in Farenheit.  [WHY? Why are you using non SI units at all?]
 - burn trial climate data taken with Kestrel 5000 (check model). Wind speed in miles per hour, Temperature in Farenheit, Relative Humidity in Percentage.
 
  

## Burning trials notes

 - Thermocouples height and distance: 
 
 [I don;t understand this].
 
Height:
Left:7 inch
D1: 6.55 inch
Middle: 7.25 inch
D2: 6.75 inch
Right: 8inch
Distnace:
Left: 7.5 inch
D1: 12.5 inch
Middle: 16 inch
D2: 22.5 inch
Right: 27.5 inch.

## Other notes?


Haven't measured the maximum temperature for first nine sample plus ED35.

Maximum temperature measured by pointing the infrared thermometer at the burning site after ten seconds ignition.

Two infrred thermometer showed two different temperature.I used the new, yellow one.

Haven't measured the maximum temperature for first nine samples.

Maximum temperature measured by pointing the infrared thermometer at the burning site after ten seconds ignition.

Drying period was 24 hours for first burn for first nine samples.

Few samples were less than 70 cm from the first trip.

Got the hobo data (temperature and humidity of the drying period) only from the last second burn of second trip.

Got 24 hours of hobo data of the second burn of second trip samples.

The width measured in inch(Bottom,Middle and Top Width).

The leaf sample for ED11 is missing and I didn't measure it's LMA.

Some samples are less than 70 cm.

I have confusion with some species in terms of identification.

Species like juniper, mimosa, pinus I did measured only the projection not the morphological leaf area.

*Senegalia wrightii* and *Senegalia romeriana* are morphologically similar.

Want to exclude the Yucca rupicola since I have collected only one sample.

Looks like *Quercus buckleyi* and *Q. shummardii* are similar in terms of morphology.

Collected one *Quercus virginiana* and want to exclude that.

Want to add Juniperus pinchottii,Forestiera reticulata, Rhus trilobata, Garrya elliptica.

Flame duration of RE03 is 5:18 or 318 seconds
