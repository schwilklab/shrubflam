(ii) Are heat release and flame spread relatively independent axes of flammability in shrub fuels?***
(iii) Is total biomass more important than leaf traits and canopy traits in shrubs?***
(iv) What is the relationship between canopy traits and fire and how those individual traits associated with different components of flammability? 
(v) Are canopy traits more important than leaf traits in canopy flammability?
