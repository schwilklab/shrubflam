# Haven't measured the maximum temperature for first nine sample plus ED35.
# Maximum temperature measured by pointing the infrared thermometer at the burning site after ten seconds ignition.
# Two infrred thermometer showed two different temperature.I used the new, yellow one.
# Haven't measured the maximum temperature for first nine sample.
# Maximum temperature measured by pointing the infrared thermometer at the burning site after ten seconds ignition.
# Drying period was 24 hours for first burn for first nine samples.
# Few samples were less than 70 cm from the first trip.
# Got the hobo data (Temperature and Humidity of the drying period) only from the last second burn of second trip.
# Got 24 hours of hobo data of the second burn of second trip samples.

Canopy Density:
# The width measured in inch(Bottom,Middle and Top Width).
# The leaf sample for ED11 is missing and I didn't measure it's LMA.
# Some samples are less than 70 cm.
# I have confusion with some species in terms of identification.
# Leaf area measured in centimeter square.
# Emissivity of the thermometer is .95.
# Species like juniper, mimosa, pinus I did measured only the projection not the morphological leaf area.
# Senegalia wrightii and senegalia romeriana are morphologically same.
# Want to exclude the Yucca rupicola since I have collected only one sample.
# Looks like Quercus buckleyi and shummardii are similar in terms of morphology.
# Collected one Quercus virginianna and want to exclude that.
# Want to add Juniperus pinchottii,Forestiera reticulata, Rhus trilobata, Garrya elliptica.
# Flame duration of RE03 is 5:18 or 318 seconds
